# Skin-Lesion_Segmentation

Skin lesion segmentation is an important process in skin diagnostics because it improves manual and computer-aided diagnostics by focusing the medical personnel on specific parts of the skin. One of the most dangerous types of this cancer is melanoma which requires an early and accurate detection. However, automatic melanoma segmentation on dermoscopic images is a challenging task since images are corrupted by noise like hairs, air bubbles, blood vessel... and with fuzzy boundaries.

Image segmentation is a common task in computer vision that partitions a digital image into multiple segments, for which deep neural networks have been proven to be reliable. In this project,  a Deep Learning architecture called SegNet has been used. The model is trained on limited images from PH2 dataset which includes the manual segmentation, the clinical diagnosis, and the identiÔ¨Åcation of several dermoscopic structures, performed by expert dermatologists.
